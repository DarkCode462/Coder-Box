> HI THIS A LUNCHER BASED ON WINDOWS< LINUX< MAC< ANDROID

Hi, i am a android Developer, developing apps From 3 Years, I was Very amazed by The concepts of Different Operating System an Their features, Then a Idea came in my mind, 

Basically for desktop Most of the users can shift from one Operating System to Another But in case of android Phone only a limited amount of people are willing to do that. an other's who love to customise their Phone they install all different types of app Like 1 Launcher, 2 widget plugin app, 3 icons Modifiers etc.. but in this launchers case Your will get the above features integrated in one single launcher an many other features like :



FEATURES

>> Command Line Interface Like Linux

>> Cool UI Like Mac

>> Themes, plugins Like Unix Porn 

>> Fast File Sharing Like IOS 

>> Better File System An Shortcuts Like Windows

>> A IDE that can integrate with command Line Interface an Compile any program

(Only For Developers)
